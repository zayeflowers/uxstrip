            UXstrip started with one simple idea: capture the funny, frustrating, and absurd moments of working in UX.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
            In early 2025, UXstrip was created in just a few hours by a designer who wanted to turn real experiences into a comic series â€” simple, human, and relatable. No big studio. No polished committees. Just pure creative energy and a love for the quirks of UX life.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
            Today, UXstrip continues to grow as a playful space for designers, developers, researchers, and product managers to laugh at the highs, lows, and everything in between.
